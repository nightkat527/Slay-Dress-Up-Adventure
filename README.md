Game Prototype: “Slay Dress Up Adventure”
When I first thought about this assignment I wasn’t going to create anything close to what I ended up making. At first I was going to make a RPG decision-based game about a little girl who appears to be sweet but is slowly losing her sanity as she does aimless tasks over and over again…I know it's a bit dark but I thought it would be interesting. Although, with a combination of time, limitations, and the fact I wanted a physical, and playable game I went with a base idea centered around humor and kept the idea of a twist, which made me journey down the rabbit hole of creating a Twine game. I had an idea to transition from an adventure style to a cutesy dress-up experience. So, In this postmortem, I'll delve into my process, the difficulties encountered, and how the non-linear aspects contributed to the overall aesthetic and creative freedom featured in the player's experience.

So, for “Slay Dress Up Adventure” My initial concept for the game prototype revolved around throwing players expectations off with a humorous twist. Drawing inspiration from classic adventure games, I aimed to create an immersive experience of rouge games where you can input your name and have it fed back to you in text, as well as a key aspect, including medieval music to add to the overall tone. In fact, sound is important in the beginning of the game, it’s meant to tie you in and then boom, hit the next page and “record scratch” the game has changed. My overall idea to transition from an adventure setup to a dress-up game stemmed from my original idea of cutesy to horror, so I almost attempted to switch it. 

So, let's discuss the platform I used, Twine, this was in no way shape or form a deliberate choice. Although it helped to have a software that already includes the non-linear aspect of choice. Anyways, as discussed, I initially considered RPG Maker MV mostly for visuals, I ultimately chose Twine for a simpler and easier prototype. I knew I could still implement images and when taking into consideration what I can and absolutely can’t do I decided on my theme. Twine helped me lower my expectations of a grand game made in a short timeframe, something my brain tends to want me to try and do every time I am tasked with creating a game prototype. Anyways, I ended up using a preexisting game called Everskies for the images and I took them into canva to make the actual character, who happens to also be the narrator, which is who we are dressing up as.    

The overall dress-up game has core choices, including three hair options, five shirt options, and five bottom options, which includes skirts and pants. I carefully selected each item to offer players a variety of aesthetics to experiment with. Each piece of clothing was selected to hopefully encourage individuality while playing. This is to allow players to personalize the narrator's appearance and express their creativity through the storyline. Oh, of course and to also make a super slay outfit!

One of the primary challenges encountered during the development process was navigating the limitations of Twine, particularly in managing branching pathways and maintaining coherence within the storyline. As I added choices, the complexity of the narrative structure grew, this made it difficult to organize and visualize the branching paths. I actually have an early prototype of the prototype where I gave the player an option to change the color of their hair in the game. Let me just say you don’t realize how quickly those possibilities can add up until you’re actually creating them. 

Furthermore, balancing the number of choices while ensuring that each item can somewhat compliment each other was a huge goal for myself. I did initially think about having a choice to make a really ugly outfit and then have the narrator act upset, but I honestly liked the process of making nicer outfit combinations and the number of choices I landed on. You have to break it down and consider that too many choices risked overwhelming players, while too few choices could lead to a lack of engagement. Striking the right balance required careful consideration on my part, as well as encouraging my friends to playtest the game. 

There was also the issue of creating passages with similar names, as I would need the player to select their hair color, and I decided to actually put the color instead of just hair one, hair two, or hair three to add to the players personality, reflecting from the narrators. Adding phrases like, “blonde, duh” or "Totally, brunette” to get a feel of what we now sound like because of the game. This created an overwhelming issue of creatively designing individual passage names that sound like each other and implementing each one (over 50 passages). The other issue being the 100 and then some images that I placed into each passage. This took hours to make sure I was placing the right image into the right passage. 
The non-linear aspects of the game, particularly the choice of outfit and aesthetics, completely shaped the game as a whole. It  played a crucial role in shaping the narrative and player experience. By allowing players to select from a wide range of clothing options, the game offered a sense of creative freedom, empowering players to personalize the narrator's appearance and express their individual style.

Moreover, I placed a hidden outfit into the game that is hinted at in the beginning. This also adds to the non-linear aspect of the game. If you end up choosing all the pieces that are meant to represent who the narrator actually is/what she is originally supposed to look like, you can reach a secret path and earn a trophy before finishing the game. I feel like the hidden outfit/hair option added an element of discovery and reward, encouraging players to explore alternative pathways and uncover hidden content. The inclusion of the hidden option not only contributed to the replay value of the game but also reinforced the theme of changing up what you would usually choose, kind of like how I ended up designing this prototype.

In conclusion, the process of creating my Twine game prototype was both challenging and rewarding. By blending the elements of adventure and dress-up, I feel like I created something really different and fun to play. I aimed to surprise the player's expectations and deliver a humorous and engaging experience. Despite encountering difficulties in navigating Twine's limitations and the intense process of adding in the 100 of images I generated, the non-linear aspects of the game contributed meaningfully to its overall shape and message. Moving forward, I intend to further explore the possibilities of non-linear storytelling and continue pushing the boundaries of an interactive narrative design, most likely actually using RPG Maker, instead of Twine
